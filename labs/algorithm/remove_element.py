# Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of
# that value in-place and return the new length.
#
# Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying
# the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
#
# The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond
# the new length.

# Learning:
# I did not read the problem statement correctly and was returning different value
# than desired.
